## Bug https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/issues/21
## affects only SKX-W/X (Workstation and HEDT segments); product segment
## can be determined by checking bits 5..3 of the CAPID0 field in PCU registers
## device (see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/specification-updates/xeon-scalable-spec-update.pdf#page=13
## for Server/FPGA/Fabric segments description; for SKX-W/X no public
## documentation seems to be available).  Specific device/function numbers
## are provided for speeding up the search only, VID:DID is the real selector.
## Commented out since revision 0x2006906 seems to fix the issue.

## The "kernel_early" statements are carried over from the intel caveat config
## in order to avoid enabling this newer microcode on these problematic kernels;
## see the caveat description in /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/caveats/intel_readme
## (That also means that this caveat has to be enforced separately on these
## kernels.)
